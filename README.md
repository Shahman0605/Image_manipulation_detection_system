# ImageForgeryDetect - README

## Overview
ImageForgeryDetect is an image manipulation detection system developed to address the challenges posed by copy-move and splicing forgeries. The objective of this project was to create a robust system that accurately identifies manipulated images using various techniques such as deep learning, image processing algorithms, and relevant methodologies.

## Problem Statement
The main challenge was to detect two common types of forgeries: copy-move and splicing. Copy-move forgery involves copying and pasting specific portions of an image, while splicing forgery merges multiple images to create a composite image. Our system aimed to provide accurate detection of these manipulations.

## Approach
We adopted a multi-model approach to tackle the problem. Although we initially planned to evaluate three different models on the dataset, we encountered computational limitations that allowed us to test only one model. However, we completed the pretraining of the other two models on the CASIA2.0_revised dataset for future evaluation.

The chosen model was a deep learning-based architecture that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. We fine-tuned the pre-trained model on our curated dataset to enhance its performance in detecting image manipulations.

## Dataset
To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we have meticulously curated a dataset comprising three classes: authentic, copy-moved, and spliced images. The dataset is thoughtfully partitioned into traindev and test sets, while a separate hold-out test dataset is reserved for unbiased benchmarking. Additionally, the dataset includes masks that precisely delineate the regions affected by copy-move and splicing forgeries, offering valuable ground truth for detailed evaluation and analysis. This project addresses real-world challenges and aims to safeguard the integrity of digital imagery.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Computational limitations: Due to limited computational resources, we could only test one model on the dataset. However, we successfully completed the pretraining of the other two models on the CASIA2.0_revised dataset, which can be used for further evaluation in the future.
- Model selection: Selecting an appropriate model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency was crucial. We opted for a pre-trained deep learning model, which demonstrated promising results in prior image manipulation detection tasks.
- Training data imbalance: The dataset had imbalanced class distributions, which could have affected the model's performance. We addressed this challenge by implementing data augmentation techniques and carefully selecting evaluation metrics that account for class imbalances.
- Metric selection: We evaluated the model's performance using class-wise classification accuracy and the confusion matrix. These metrics provided valuable insights into the system's ability to detect different types of forgeries. Additionally, we encouraged users to explore additional metrics to enhance their analysis.

## Results
Unfortunately, we could only report the results for the model we tested on the dataset. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 87% on the test dataset. Class-wise classification accuracy and the confusion matrix are provided below:

- Authentic: 92% accuracy 

Classwise-classification metrics: 

- True Positive Rate: 43% accuracy
- True Negative Rate: 78% accuracy
- False Positive Rate: 22% accuracy
- False Negative Rate: 57% accuracy

| Copy-moved     |        4%          |         43%           |       16%         |
| Spliced        |        9%          |         15%           |       78%         |
