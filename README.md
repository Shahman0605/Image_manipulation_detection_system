# ImageForgeryDetect
Description:
ImageForgeryDetect is a powerful image manipulation detection system designed to address the challenges posed by copy-move and splicing forgeries. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as deep learning, image processing algorithms, and other relevant methodologies, this project aims to provide a robust solution for identifying manipulated images with maximum accuracy.

Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced image manipulation detection system capable of accurately detecting two common types of forgeries: copy-move and splicing. Copy-move forgery involves duplicating a specific portion of an image and pasting it onto another area within the same image, while splicing forgery merges multiple images to create a single composite image, combining different elements or regions from various sources.

Objective:
The main goal of ImageForgeryDetect is to achieve a state-of-the-art image manipulation detection system that surpasses existing methods in terms of accuracy. It offers the flexibility to employ various approaches or combinations of techniques, such as deep learning, image processing algorithms, or other relevant methodologies, to achieve the desired results.

Metrics:
To ensure comprehensive reporting, ImageForgeryDetect provides class-wise classification accuracy and a confusion matrix as part of its analysis. Additionally, users are encouraged to evaluate the system on additional metrics to enhance their understanding and assessment of the performance.

Data:
ImageForgeryDetect comes with a meticulously curated dataset that encompasses images classified into three categories: authentic, copy-moved, and spliced. The dataset is divided into traindev and test sets, with the test set designated for benchmarking the system's performance. The dataset can be downloaded from the provided link, which includes masks for identifying copy-moved and spliced regions within the images.
